# Notes
- Please use camelCase for classes. Example: camelCase
- please use a specific class for your files so that it does not clash with similar named classes on other files. Example: if you are working on a contact page, add "contact" before all your classes. No generic classes like "header", "logo". 
- Function and Classes should not be camelCase, it should be PascalCase. Meaning every words first letter is capitalized. Example: PascalCase
- Please do not use percentages or vh (viewport-based units) for heights. Lets stick to pixels if we can.
- In order to make our codes uniform lets stick with modules.css.
- When building a page, pleae consider using components that can be reused on other pages as well. Like search can be reused on Homepage, jobs results page and employers page.
